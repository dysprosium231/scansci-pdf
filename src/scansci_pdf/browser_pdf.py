"""Browser-side helpers shared by the institutional download flows (CARSI, WebVPN).

Publisher PDFs opened in a visible browser often end up in Chrome's inline PDF
viewer (e.g. ScienceDirect: pdfft -> pdf.sciencedirectassets.com). The response
listener cannot read that body, an out-of-browser request is challenged by
Cloudflare, and a page fetch() cannot read a cross-origin redirect. So the browser
itself must open the URL, and the body is read while the response is paused via
the CDP Fetch domain.
